# Neural_Net
<img src = "NeuralNetworkImage.jpg" width ="40%">
Neural Net is a simple neural network library I built from scratch, using only numpy to assist me when feeding forward or doing back propogation. The library allows the user to adjust the number of layers, number of nodes in each layer as well as the learning rate of the network.

The reason I created this project was due to my interest in machine learning which was sparked by a recent research project I took part of. In this project I used machine learning and NLP to automatically detect fake news, however I used only prebuilt libraries for the ML thus giving me limited understanding of how my machine worked. Thus I decided to try and gain a better understanding of one of the most popular machine learning algorithims, the neural network.

To use the library
  1. Move the NeuralNet.py file to your current project directory
  2. Import NeuralNet.py in the file you wish to use the neural network
  3. Use the Test.py file as reference
